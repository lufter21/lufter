					High-quality web development of your project. I do not design the site, i work exclusively with the provided mockups.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>I do:</b>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						HTML layout of the site: make a working site from a "picture"
					</li>
					<li>
						Server-side programming: for example, sending data from a form to an e-mail
					</li>
					<li>
						Layout and creating a WordPress theme: create a WordPress theme with your design
					</li>
					<li>
						Creating a WordPress theme from your HTML templates
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					I do not work with postpay. I cooperate exclusively through a freelance exchange with making a secure transaction: funds are frozen on the exchange account, after successful completion of the project - transferred to me, or returned to you if the project is not completed. This ensures that the project will be completed. This guarantees me that the work will be paid. I pay all commissions of the exchange.<br> 
					I offer such exchanges: <a href="https://www.upwork.com" target="_blank">upwork.com</a>, <a href="https://www.fl.ru" target="_blank">fl.ru</a> or <a href="https://www.weblancer.net" target="_blank">weblancer.net</a>, you can also offer a convenient exchange for you, with secure transaction function.
				</p>
				<h2>HTML layout, frontend</h2>
				<p>
					You provide the design and i make a working website from the "picture". Mockups must be in .psd format or made in zeplin, figma.
				</p>
				<p>
					Naturally, iâ€™m not just limited to layout, besides doing animations, various effects, and client-side programming. you will get a template with working interactive elements: forms with instant input validation, pop-up windows, sliders, calculators, timers, charts, graphs, embedding the functionality of third-party services and much more. I also perform an adaptation, adaptive layout: the template will adapt to different screen sizes, from a smartphone to a large monitor.
				</p>
				<p>
					You will receive a site that can already be filled with content, uploaded to a hosting and opened in a browser.
				</p>
				<h2>Programming, backend</h2>
				<p>
					I perform programming on the server side, in php. For example, sending data from a form to an e-mail, reading from a database, writing to the database, parsing, integration of third-party services, and much more.
				</p>
				<h2>WordPress theme creation</h2>
				<p>
					If the site is small, for example, a business card of 5-10 pages that you can do without CMS (content management systems). But if this is a blog or news site, where there can be a lot of pages, without a CMS it will be very difficult to manage the site. One of the most popular CMS is WordPress.
				</p>
				<p>
					I create a theme for WordPress on your mockups, after making an HTML template, or from your finished HTML template.

					<div class="title">Cost of services</div>
					<p>
						To estimate the cost, i need to see the source data, mockups, templates, technical specifications.
					</p>
					<p>
						Contact me in any way on the <a href="/contacts.html">Contacts page</a>.<br> 
						Describe the task, send mockups, for evaluation you can send images in jpg, png, gif and etc. formats, or a link to a remote repository.
